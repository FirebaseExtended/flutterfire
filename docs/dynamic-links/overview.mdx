title: Dynamic Links for Firebase
sidebar_label: Overview

## What does it do?

Dynamic Links are links that work the way you want, on multiple platforms, and whether or not your app is already installed.
If a user opens a Dynamic Link on iOS or Android, they can be taken directly to the linked content in your native app.
If a user doesn't have your app installed, the user can be prompted to install it; then, after installation, your app starts
and can access the link.

## Installation

### 1. Make sure to initialize Firebase

[Follow this guide](../overview.mdx) to install `firebase_core` and initialize Firebase if you haven't already.

### 2. Add dependency

On the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash {5}
flutter pub add firebase_dynamic_links
```

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Platform Integration

Before using Dynamic Links, ensure you have configured your specific platform:

- [Android](./android-integration.mdx)
- [Apple](./apple-integration.mdx)

## Next steps

Once your platforms have been configured, head over to the [Usage](./usage.mdx) documentation.
