## Apple Account

To setup Dynamic Links on iOS, it is a prerequisite that you have an Apple developer account [setup](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/).

## Configure your App in the Firebase Console

Add an "App Store ID" & "Team ID" to your app in your Firebase console. If you do not have an "App Store ID" yet, you can put any number in here for now.
Your "Team ID" can be found in your Apple developer console.

Test the domain (e.g. `https://your-dynamic-link-domain`) you have created in your Firebase console. Go to the following location in your browser "[your domain]/apple-app-site-association".
The response will have a details array property containing an object that has the property "appID". That will be your app's app ID (It may take some time for
your domain to register). Please ensure it is registered before proceeding.

## Apple Developer Console

Create a provisioning profile for your app. Please ensure you've enabled the "Associated Domain" capability which you should check before proceeding.

## Project Opened on Xcode

Open your app under the "TARGETS" header. Click the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. You will need to ensure your "Team" is registered, and your "Provisioning Profile" field is completed.
Please add the domain you created in your Firebase console to the "Associated Domains" and prefix with "applinks:"

Click the "Info" tab, and add a "URL Type" to your project. The "Identifier" can be called "Bundle Id" or whatever you wish. Add your bundle identifier to the "URL Schemes" property.


## Dynamic Links With Custom Domains

If you have set up a custom domain for your Firebase project, you must add the dynamic link URL prefix into your iOS project's "Info.plist" file by using the "FirebaseDynamicLinksCustomDomains" key.
You can add multiple URLs as well.

## Test Dynamic Links

To test your dynamic link, you will need to use a real device as it will not work on a simulator. You will also have to run the app in release mode (i.e. "flutter run --release") as iOS will block you from opening
the app in debug mode from a dynamic link.
