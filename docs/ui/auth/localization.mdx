title: Localization
---

Firebase UI widgets support localization, so every single text label used by Firebase UI widgets can be customized.

If your app supports only a signle langugage, and you want to override labels – you will need to provide a custom class that implements [`DefaultLocalizations`](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutterfire_ui/latest/i10n/DefaultLocalizations-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:flutterfire_ui/i10n.dart';

class LabelOverrides extends DefaultLocalizations {
  const LabelOverrides();

  @override
  String get emailInputLabel => 'Enter your email';

  @override
  String get passwordInputLabel => 'Enter your password';
}
```

and pass the instance of `LabelOverrides` to the `localizationsDelegates`.

```dart
class FirebaseAuthUIExample extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      // ...
      localizationsDelegates: [
        // Creates an instance of FirebaseUILocalizationDelegate with overriden labels
        FirebaseUILocalizations.withDefaultOverrides(const LabelOverrides()),
        // Delegates below take care of built-in flutter widgets
        GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
        GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
        // This delegate is required to provide the labels that are not overriden by LabelOverrides
        FirebaseUILocalizations.delegate,
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

If you need to support multiple languages – follow the [official flutter localization guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#an-alternative-class-for-the-apps-localized-resources) and make sure that your custom delegate extends `LocalizationsDelegate<FirebaseUILocalizations>`.
