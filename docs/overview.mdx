Welcome to FlutterFire! ðŸ”¥

FlutterFire is a set of Flutter plugins which connect your Flutter application to [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create (or have an existing) Flutter project and also
have an active Firebase project. If you do not meet these prerequisites, follow the links below:

- [Getting Started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- [Create a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

Before any Firebase services can be used, you must first install the [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
plugin, which is responsible for connecting your application to Firebase. Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: {{ plugins.firebase_core }}
```

Install the plugin by running the following command from the project root:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Platform Setup

Once installed, Firebase needs to be configured to work with the various platforms you're working with:

1. [Android Installation](installation/android.mdx).
1. [iOS Installation](installation/ios.mdx).
1. [Web Installation](installation/web.mdx).

## Initializing FlutterFire

Before any of the Firebase services can be used, FlutterFire needs to be initialized (you can think of this process as
FlutterFire "bootstrapping" itself). The initialization step is asynchronous, meaning you'll need to prevent any FlutterFire
related usage until the initialization is completed.

To initialize FlutterFire, call the `initializeApp` method on the `FirebaseCore` instance:

```dart
await FirebaseCore.instance.initializeApp();
```

The method is asynchronous and returns a [`Future`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html), so
you need to ensure it has completed before displaying your main application. The examples below show how this can be
achieved with a [`FutureBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html) or
a [`StatefulWidget`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="future"
  values={[
    { label: 'FutureBuilder', value: 'future', },
    { label: 'StatefulWidget', value: 'state', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="future">

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Import the firebase_core plugin
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(App());
}

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      // Initialize FlutterFire
      future: FirebaseCore.instance.initializeApp(),
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        // Once complete, show your application
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          return MyAwesomeApp();
        } else
        // Show something whilst waiting for initialization to complete
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting) {
          return Loading();
        } else
        // Handle any errors
        if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return SomethingWentWrong();
        }

        return null;
      },
    );
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="state">

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Import the firebase_core plugin
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(App());
}

class App extends StatefulWidget {
  _AppState createState() => _AppState();
}

class _AppState extends State<App> {
  // Set default `_initialized` state to false
  bool _initialized = false;

  // Define an async function to initialize FlutterFire
  void initializeFlutterFire() async {
    await FirebaseCore.instance.initializeApp();

    // Once initialized, set the `_initialized` state to true
    setState(() {
      _initialized = true;
    });
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initializeFlutterFire();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Show a loader until FlutterFire is initialized
    if (!_initialized) {
      return Loading();
    }

    return MyAwesomeApp();
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once initialized, you're ready to get started using FlutterFire!

## Next Steps

On it's own the `firebase_core` plugin provides basic functionality for usage with Firebase. FlutterFire is broken down
into a number of individual installable plugins which allow you to integrate with a specific Firebase service.

The table below lists all of the currently supported plugins. You can follow the documentation for each plugin to
get started:

| Firebase       | Description | FlutterFire Plugin                |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| AdMob          |             | [firebase_admob](admob/usage.mdx) |
| Analytics      |             |                                   |
| Authentication |             |                                   |
