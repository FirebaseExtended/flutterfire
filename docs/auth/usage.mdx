Once installed, you can access the [`firebase_auth`](!firebase_auth) plugin by importing it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';
```

## Listening to authentication state

The FirebaseAuth module provides a method called `onAuthStateChanged` which allows you to subscribe to the users current
authentication state, and receive an event whenever the state changes.


## Persisting authentication state

## Anonymous sign-in

Sometimes you may not want to require authentication, however still want to be identify what users are doing throughout
your application. If connecting to an external API, it can also be used to add an extra layer of security by ensuring the
users request is from the app.  This can be achieved by using the `signInAnonymously` method which creates a new
persistent anonymous user. This allows you to integrate into other services such as Analytics, by provided a user ID.authentication

Ensure the "Anonymous" sign in provide is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInAnonymously()).user;
```

## Email/Password Registration & Sign-in

Email/Password is a common user sign in method for most applications.  This requires the user to provide an email address
and secure password. Users can register with a method called `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` or sign in to an existing
account with `signInWithEmailAndPassword`

Ensure the "Email/Password" sign in provider is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers)

The `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` method performs two operations. It first creates the user if they do not already
exist, and then signs them in:

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
  email: 'clark.kent@example.com',
  password:'SuperSecretPassword!',
)).user;
```

## Signing Out

To sign a user out of their current authentication state, call the `signOut` method:

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
```

## Other sign-in methods

Firebase also supports authenticating with external provides. To learn more, view the documentation for your authentication method:

- Apple Sign-In.
- Facebook Sign-In.
- Twitter Sign-In.
- Google Sign-In.
- Phone Number Sign-In.

## Using secondary apps

Firebase Authentication supports using [secondary Firebase apps](core/usage#secondary-firebase-apps), allowing you to
authenticate users with multiple Firebase projects at once.

To use a secondary app, pass the `FirebaseApp` instance to the `instanceFor` method:

```dart
FirebaseApp secondaryApp = FirebaseCore.instance.app('SecondayApp');

FirebaseAuth auth = FirebaseAuth.instanceFor(
  app: secondaryApp
);
```
