## Social Providers

### Apple

Apple has [announced](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09122019b) that any applications using 3rd party login
services (such as Facebook, Twitter, Google etc) must have an Apple Sign-In method.Authentication

> To Do

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
// Apple credentials
final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential)).user;
```

### Facebook

Before getting started, ensure you have installed the library, [configured your Android & iOS applications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/)
and setup your [Facebook Developer Account](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk#3-configure-projects) to enable Facebook Login.

Ensure the "Facebook" sign-in provider is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).
with the Facebook App ID and Secret set.

#### Installation

1. Add dependency

```yaml {2} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter_facebook_auth: ^0.2.3
```

2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter_facebook_auth/flutter_facebook_auth.dart';

Future<void> signInWithFacebook() async {
  try {
      final LoginResult result = await FacebookAuth.instance.login();

      final FacebookAuthCredential facebookAuthCredential = FacebookAuthProvider.credential(result.accessToken.token);

      await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(facebookAuthCredential);
  } catch (e) {
      // Handle Error
  }
}

### Twitter

Ensure the "Twitter" sign-in provider is enabled on the Firebase Console.

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
final AuthCredential credential = TwitterAuthProvider.getCredential(
  authToken: 'abc123',
  authTokenSecret: 'SuperSecretToken'
);

final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential)).user;
```

### Google

> Wording needs rework

Most configuration is already setup when using Google Sign-In with Firebase, however you need to ensure your machines
SHA1 key has been configured for use with Android. You can see view how to generate the key on the
[Getting Started](overview) documentation.

Ensure the "Google" sign-in provider is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).

#### Installation

1. Add dependency

```yaml {2} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  google_sign_in: ^4.5.1
```

2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

#### Usage

Once your Firebase instance has been initialized, you can call the Google Sign In method, which will prompt the user to
sign into their Google account.  Once this has been done, their `AuthCredential` will be passed to the the `FirebaseAuth`
`signInWithCredential` method:

```dart
import 'package:google_sign_in/google_sign_in.dart';

Future<void> signInWithGoogle() async {
  try {
    final GoogleSignInAccount googleUser = await GoogleSignIn().signIn();
    final GoogleSignInAuthentication googleAuth = await googleUser.authentication;

    final AuthCredential credential = GoogleAuthProvider.credential(
       accessToken: googleAuth.accessToken,
       idToken: googleAuth.idToken,
    );

    await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential);

  } catch (e) {
      // Handle Error
  }
}


```


### GitHub

Ensure the "GitHub" sign-in provider is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
final AuthCredential credential = GithubAuthProvider.getCredential(
  token: 'ABC123',
);

final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential)).user;
```
