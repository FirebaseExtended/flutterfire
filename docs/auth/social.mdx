services (such as Facebook, Twitter, Google etc) must have an Apple Sign-In method.Authentication

> To Do

```dart title="NEEDS UPDATING/VALIDATING"
// Apple credentials
final FirebaseUser user = (await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithCredential(credential)).user;
```

Before getting started, ensure you have installed the library, [configured your Android & iOS applications](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/)
and setup your [Facebook Developer Account](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk#3-configure-projects) to enable Facebook Login.

Ensure the "Facebook" sign-in provider is enabled on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).
