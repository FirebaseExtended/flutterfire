## 1. Things you will need

- Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.
- [git](https://git-scm.com) (used for source version control).
- An ssh client (used to authenticate with GitHub).
- An IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [`flutter_plugin_tools`](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_plugin_tools) locally activated.
- [`tuneup`](https://pub.dev/packages/tuneup) locally activated.

## 2. Forking & cloning the repository

- Ensure all the dependencies described in the previous section are installed.
- Fork `https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire` into your own GitHub account. If
  you already have a fork, and are now installing a development environment on
  a new machine, make sure you've updated your fork so that you don't use stale
  configuration options from long ago.
- If you haven't configured your machine with an SSH key that's known to github, then
  follow [GitHub's directions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
  to generate an SSH key.
- `git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/flutterfire.git`
- `git remote add upstream git@github.com:FirebaseExtended/flutterfire.git` (So that you
  fetch from the master repository, not your clone, when running `git fetch`
  et al.)

## 3. Environment Setup

FlutterFire uses [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and dependencies.

To install Melos, run the following command from your SSH client:

```bash
pub global activate melos
```

Next, at the root of your locally cloned repository bootstrap the projects dependencies:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command locally links all dependencies within the project without having to
provide manual [`dependency_overrides`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec). This allows all
plugins, examples and tests to build from the local clone project.

## 4. Running an example

Each plugin provides an example app which aims to showcase the main use-cases of each plugin.

To run an example, run the `flutter run` command from the `example` directory of each plugins main
directory. For example, for Cloud Firestore example:

```bash
cd packages/cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore/example
flutter run
```

Using Melos (installed in step 3), any changes made to the plugins locally will also be reflected within all
example applications code automatically.

## 4. Running tests

FlutterFire comprises of a number of tests for each plugin, either end-to-end (e2e) or unit tests.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are responsible for ensuring expected behaviour whilst developing the plugins Dart code. Unit tests do not
interact with 3rd party Firebase services, and mock where possible. To run unit tests for a specific plugin, run the
`flutter test` command from the plugins root directory. For example, Cloud Firestore platform interface tests can be run
with the following commands:

```bash
cd packages/cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore_platform_interface
flutter test
```

### End-to-end (e2e) tests

E2e tests are those which directly communicate with Firebase, whose results cannot be mocked. These tests run directly from
an example application. To run e2e tests, run the `flutter drive` command from the plugins main `example` directory, targeting the
entry e2e test file:

** Please ensure the cloud firestore emulator is running for any db related tests. https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage/#emulator-usage **

```bash
cd packages/cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore/example
flutter drive --target=./test_driver/cloud_firestrore_e2e.dart
```

To run tests against web environments, run the command as a release build:

```bash
cd packages/cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore/example
flutter drive --target=./test_driver/cloud_firestrore_e2e.dart --release -d chrome
```

### Using Melos

To help aid developer workflow, Melos provides a number of commands to quickly run
tests against plugins. For example, to run all e2e tests across all plugins at once,
run the following command from the root of your cloned repository:

```bash
melos run test:e2e
```

A full list of all commands can be found within the [`melos.yaml`](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/blob/master/melos.yaml)
file.

## 5. Contributing code

We gladly accept contributions via GitHub pull requests.

Please peruse the
[Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) and
[design principles](https://flutter.io/design-principles/) before
working on anything non-trivial. These guidelines are intended to
keep the code consistent and avoid common pitfalls.

To start working on a patch:

1. `git fetch upstream`
2. `git checkout upstream/master -b <name_of_your_branch>`
3. Hack away!

Once you have made your changes, ensure that it passes the internal analyzer & formatting checks. The following
commands can be run locally to highlight any issues before committing your code:

```bash
# Run the analyze check
melos run analyze

# Format code
melos run format
```

Assuming all is successful, commit and push your code:

1. `git commit -a -m "<your informative commit message>"`
2. `git push origin <name_of_your_branch>`

To send us a pull request:

- `git pull-request` (if you are using [Hub](http://github.com/github/hub/)) or
  go to `https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire` and click the
  "Compare & pull request" button

Please make sure all your checkins have detailed commit messages explaining the patch.

When naming the title of your pull request, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
guide. For example, for a fix to the Cloud Firestore plugin:

`fix(cloud_firestore): Fixed a bug!`

Plugins tests are run automatically on contributions using GitHub Actions. Depending on
your code contributions, various tests will be run against your updated code automatically.

Once you've gotten an LGTM from a project maintainer and once your PR has received
the green light from all our automated testing, wait for one the package maintainers
to merge the pull request.

You must complete the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).
You can do this online, and it only takes a minute.
If you've never submitted code before, you must add your (or your
organization's) name and contact info to the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.

### The review process

Newly opened PRs first go through initial triage which results in one of:

- **Merging the PR** - if the PR can be quickly reviewed and looks good.
- **Closing the PR** - if the PR maintainer decides that the PR should not be merged.
- **Moving the PR to the backlog** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue isn't a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Make sure that the PR has an associated issue labeled with "plugin".
  - Add the "backlog" label to the issue.
  - Leave a comment on the PR explaining that the review is not trivial and that the issue will be looked at according to priority order.
- **Starting a non trivial review** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue is a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Add the "in review" label to the issue.
  - Self assign the PR.

### The release process

We push releases manually. Generally every merged PR upgrades at least one
plugin's `pubspec.yaml`, so also needs to be published as a package release. The
FlutterFire maintainer most involved with the PR should be the person responsible
for publishing the package release. In cases where the PR is authored by a
FlutterFire maintainer, the publisher should probably be the author. In other cases
where the PR is from a contributor, it's up to the reviewing Flutter team member
to publish the release instead.

Some things to keep in mind before publishing the release:

- Has CI ran on the master commit and gone green? Even if CI shows as green on
  the PR it's still possible for it to fail on merge, for multiple reasons.
  There may have been some bug in the merge that introduced new failures. CI
  runs on PRs as it's configured on their branch state, and not on tip of tree.
  CI on PRs also only runs tests for packages that it detects have been directly
  changed, vs running on every single package on master.
- [Publishing is
  forever.](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/publishing#publishing-is-forever)
  Hopefully any bugs or breaking in changes in this PR have already been caught
  in PR review, but now's a second chance to revert before anything goes live.
- "Don't deploy on a Friday." Consider carefully whether or not it's worth
  immediately publishing an update before a stretch of time where you're going
  to be unavailable. There may be bugs with the release or questions about it
  from people that immediately adopt it, and uncovering and resolving those
  support issues will take more time if you're unavailable.

Releasing a package is a two-step process.

1. Push the package update to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) using `pub publish`.
2. Tag the commit with git in the format of `<package_name>-v<package_version>`,
   and then push the tag to the `flutter/plugins` master branch. This can be
   done manually with `git tag $tagname && git push upstream $tagname` while
   checked out on the commit that updated `version` in `pubspec.yaml`.

We've recently updated
[flutter_plugin_tools](https://github.com/flutter/plugin_tools) to wrap both of
those steps into one command to make it a little easier. This new tool is
experimental. Feel free to fall back on manually running `pub publish` and
creating and pushing the tag in git if there are issues with it.

Install the tool by running:

```terminal
$ pub global activate flutter_plugin_tools
```

Then, from the root of your locally cloned repository, use the tool to
publish a release.

```terminal
$ pub global run flutter_plugin_tools publish-plugin --package $package
```

By default the tool tries to push tags to the `upstream` remote, but that and
some additional settings can be configured. Run `pub global activate flutter_plugin_tools --help` for more usage information.

The tool wraps `pub publish` for pushing the package to pub, and then will
automatically use git to try and create and push tags. It has some additional
safety checking around `pub publish` too. By default `pub publish` publishes
_everything_, including untracked or uncommitted files in version control.
`flutter_plugin_tools publish-plugin` will first check the status of the local
directory and refuse to publish if there are any mismatched files with version
control present.

There is a lot about this process that is still to be desired. Some top level
items are being tracked in
[flutter/flutter#27258](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27258).
