# Example of Firebase Machine Learning Custom

Demonstrates how to use the firebase_ml_custom plugin.

## Usage

This example uses the *image_picker* plugin to get images from the device gallery. If using an iOS
device you will have to configure your project with the correct permissions seen under iOS
configuration [here](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/image_picker).

The example also uses the *tflite* plugin to perform inference. If using an Android device you will need to modify your `android/app/build.gradle` file as specified [here](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/tflite).
